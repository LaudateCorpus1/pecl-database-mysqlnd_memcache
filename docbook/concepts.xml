   The mysqlnd replication and load balancing plugin is
   implemented as a PHP extension.
   It is written in C and operates under the hood of PHP. During the
   startup of the PHP interpreter, in the module init phase of the
   PHP engine, it gets registered as a
   <link linkend="book.mysqlnd">mysqlnd</link> plugin to replace selected
   mysqlnd C methods.

  <para>
   At PHP runtime, it inspects queries sent from
   mysqlnd (PHP) to the MySQL server. If a query is recognized as read-only,
   it will be sent to one of the configured slave servers. Statements are
   considered read-only if they either start with <literal>SELECT</literal>,
   the SQL hint <literal>/*ms=slave*/</literal> or a slave had been chosen for
   running the previous query, and the query started with the SQL hint
   <literal>/*ms=last_used*/</literal>. In all other cases, the query will
   be sent to the MySQL replication master server.
